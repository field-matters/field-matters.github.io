## Field Matters 2023
#### The Second Workshop on NLP Applications to Field Linguistics

Field linguistics plays a crucial role in the development of linguistic theory and universal language modeling, as it provides uncontested, the only way to obtain structural data about the rapidly diminishing diversity of natural languages.

The Field matters workshop aims to bring together the urgent needs of field linguists and the vast community of NLP practitioners, developing up-to-date NLP tools for easier, faster, more reliable data collection and annotation.

**We are particularly interested in the following topics:**
+ Application of NLP to field linguistics workflow;
+ Transfer learning for under-resourced language processing;
+ The use of fieldwork data to build NLP systems;
+ Modeling morphology and syntax of typologically diverse languages in the low-resource setting;
+ Speech processing for under-resourced languages;
+ Computational analysis of field linguistics datasets;
+ Using technology for preserving culture via language;
+ Improving ways of interaction with Indigenous communities;
+ Machine-readable field linguistic datasets;
+ Studies of irregularities, norm-switching, and other examples of non-standard features in fieldwork data;
+ Demo-papers on the NLP tools for the fieldwork.


**We accept three types of papers:**
+ non-archival submissions: 2-page abstracts that can present already published work or work in progress;
+ short archival submissions: 4-page papers that present new work;
+ long archival submissions: 8-page papers that present new work.

**We offer the following ways of presenting the papers:**
+ the main section;
+ parallel/poster sections;
+ TBD

The way a paper will be presented will be determined during the review process.

**All submissions should be anonymized.**

Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paperâ€™s main conference submission id. The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated. Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by Macrh 13.

Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted without any restrictions on when they were posted.

The workshop will run its own review process, and papers can be submitted directly to the workshop via Start.

The workshop will take place at [EACL 2023](https://2023.eacl.org/).
Both papers and abstracts must follow the EACL 2023 [format](https://2023.eacl.org/calls/styles/). See EACL 2023 [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/eacl-2023-proceedings-template/fvjkskgsmgnh). **Please do not modify these style files.**

#### Submission deadline: February 13
#### Notification deadline: March 13
#### Camera-ready paper submission deadline: March 27
