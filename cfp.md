## Field Matters! 
##### [Return to the main page](https://field-matters.github.io/)
#### The first workshop on applying NLP to field linguistics

Field linguistics plays a crucial role in the development of linguistic theory and universal language modeling, as it provides uncontested, the only way to obtain structural data about the rapidly diminishing diversity of natural languages.

The Field matters workshop aims to bring together the urgent needs of field linguists and the vast community of NLP practitioners, developing up-to-date NLP tools for easier, faster, more reliable data collection and annotation.

**We are particularly interested in the following topics:**
+ Application of NLP to field linguistics workflow;
+ Transfer learning for under-resourced language processing;
+ The use of fieldwork data to build NLP systems;
+ Modeling morphology and syntax of typologically diverse languages in the low-resource setting;
+ Speech processing for under-resourced languages;
+ Computational analysis of field linguistics datasets;
+ Using technology for preserving culture via language;
+ Improving ways of interaction with Indigenious communituies;
+ Machine-readable field linguistic datasets.

**We accept three types of papers:**
+ non-archival submissions: 2-page abstracts that can present already published work or work in progress;
+ short archival submissions: 4-page abstracts that present new work;
+ long archival submissions: 8-page abstracts that present new work.

**We offer three ways of presenting the papers:**
+ the main section;
+ parallel sections;
+ the poster section plus a pre-recorded video of the presentation

The way a paper will be presented will be determined during the review process.

**All submissions should be anonymized.**

Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paper’s main conference submission id. The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated. Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by TODO.

Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted without any restrictions on when they were posted.

The workshop will run its own review process, and papers can be submitted directly to the workshop by both ARR and Start (link TBA).

The workshop will take place at [COLING 2022](https://coling2022.org/).
Both papers and abstracts must follow the COLING 2022 format (TBA). COLING 2020 [template](https://ru.overleaf.com/latex/templates/coling-2020/hfdgccxjkzqb).
