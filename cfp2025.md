# The Fourth Workshop on NLP Applications to Field Linguistics

Field linguistics plays a crucial role in the development of linguistic theory and universal language modeling, as it provides uncontested, the only way to obtain structural data about the rapidly diminishing diversity of natural languages.
The Field matters workshop aims to bring together the urgent needs of field linguists and the vast community of NLP practitioners, developing up-to-date NLP tools for easier, faster, more reliable data collection and annotation.
We encourage you to submit theses on this topic, although general submissions are also welcomed.

We are particularly interested in the following topics:
+ Application of NLP to field linguistics workflow;
+ The impact, benefits and harms of NLP-assisted fieldwork;
+ Transfer learning for under-resourced language processing;
+ The use of fieldwork data to build NLP systems;
+ Modeling morphology and syntax of typologically diverse languages in the low-resource setting;
+ Speech processing for under-resourced languages;
+ Machine-readable field linguistic datasets and computational analysis of field linguistics datasets;
+ Using technology to preserve culture via language;
+ Improving ways of interaction with Indigenous communities.

We accept three types of papers:

+ non-archival submissions: abstracts (2-page) or papers (up to 8-page) that can present already published work or work in progress (note that we accept non-archival submissions even after the main deadline);
+ short archival submissions: 4-page papers that present new work;
+ long archival submissions: 8-page papers that present new work.

The special track submissions can be either long or short and either archival or non-archival.

We offer the following ways of presenting the papers:
+ the main section;
+ poster sections.
  
The way a paper will be presented will be determined during the review process.

All submissions should be anonymized. We are subjected to the ACL Anonymity Policy. ACL changed its [policy for review and citation](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Policies_for_Review_and_Citation), and no anonymity period will be required.
Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paper’s main conference submission id. The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated. Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by.
Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted without any restrictions on when they were posted.
The workshop will run its own review process, and papers can be submitted directly to the workshop via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2025/Workshop/Field_Matters).
**The workshop will take place at [ACL 2025](https://2025.aclweb.org/).** Both papers and abstracts must follow the [ACL 2025 format](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files). Please do not modify these style files.
