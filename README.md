# Field Matters II 
## Workshop description

Field linguistics plays a crucial role in the development of linguistic theory and universal language modelling, as it provides uncontested, the only way to obtain structural data about the rapidly diminishing diversity of natural languages.

The Field matters workshop aims to bring together the urgent needs of field linguists and the vast community of NLP practitioners, developing up-to-date NLP tools for easier, faster, more reliable data collection and annotation.

**Oleg Serikov**
(HSE University, AIRI, MIPT, RAS Linguistics, 
[`oserikov@hse.ru`](mailto:oserikov@hse.ru))

is an NLP Researcher at AIR Institute. 
Oleg now writes his PhD thesis at HSE University, his main points of interest are under-resourced languages ASR, under-resourced languages modelling and linguistic interpretation of language models.
He co-organized SIGTYP 2021 and LowResourceEval 2021 shared tasks on under-resourced languages ASR.

**Elena Klyachko**
(Institute of Linguistics RAS, HSE University,
[`elenaklyachko@gmail.com`](mailto:elenaklyachko@gmail.com))

is a PhD student at HSE. Her main points of interest are Tungusic languages, which she has been studying during her fieldwork, as well as low-resource NLP.
She co-organized the SIGMORPHON 2020-2021 shared tasks on morphological reinflection, 
LowResourceEval 2019, 2021 shared tasks on NLP for field linguistic data and
SigTyp 2021 shared task on under-resourced languages ASR.

**Francis Tyers**
(Indiana University, HSE University,
[`ftyers@iu.edu`](mailto:ftyers@iu.edu))

has a huge experience with under-resourced languages processing. His reseach interests include modelling the grammar of polysyntetic languages, and application of finite-state methods to NLP. Francis is one of the core contributors of Apertium machine translation project. He has an experience of co-organizing workshops and shared tasks, including SIGMORPHON 2020-2021, CoNLL 2018.

**Valentin Malykh**

## Paper submission 
We invite both archival and non-archival submissions. 
Non-archival submissions are 2-page abstracts that could present already published work or work in progress. 
Archival submissions should be either 4- or 8-pages long.

## Dual submissions and preprints
Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paper’s main conference submission id. 
The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated. Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by September 20.

Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted without any restrictions on when they were posted.

## Camera-ready information
Authors of accepted archival papers should upload the final version of their paper to the submission system by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use one extra page to address reviewer comments, for a total of nine pages.

## Anti-Harassment Policy
Field matters 2023 adheres to the [ACL Anti-Harassment Policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy).

## Demographic Diversity
We encourage diversity in all forms. 
Workshop organizers make it their top priority the freedom of thought and expression, as well as respectful scientific debate. 
On behalf of the organizing team, we are committed to the principles of gender and sociodemographic diversity and are guided by these principles in the consideration of the workshop team, including the selection of invited speakers and PC.
